# Journal MCP server

Lets a local MCP client (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Claude Desktop) read and search the
notes you've granted it, using its own Homebase app registration — separate from the
Journal web app's session, so it can be revoked independently.

Notes and folders are hidden from every tool until you grant them access in
**Journal → Settings → Agent access**. Access defaults to **none**.

## Setup

Log in once per identity. This registers a "Journal MCP" app on your identity (its own
appId, Read+Write on the notes drive only) and saves the resulting credentials to your
OS keychain — nothing is written to disk.

```bash
npm run mcp:login -- you.dotyou.cloud
```

This prints an authorization URL and tries to open it in your browser. Approve the
Journal MCP app in the owner console; the login command then saves your credentials and
exits.

To remove the saved credentials from this machine:

```bash
npm run mcp:logout
```

To fully revoke access (e.g. from another device, or if this machine is compromised),
remove the app from the owner console: **Apps → Journal MCP**.

## Registering with an MCP client

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add journal -- npm --prefix /absolute/path/to/journal run --silent mcp
```

Codex CLI (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.journal]
command = "npm"
args = ["--prefix", "/absolute/path/to/journal", "run", "--silent", "mcp"]
```

Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "journal": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["--prefix", "/absolute/path/to/journal", "run", "--silent", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

- `list_folders` — folders you've granted access to.
- `list_notes` — granted notes, newest first (optional `folderId`, `limit`).
- `get_note` — one granted note by id, body as markdown.
- `search_notes` — case-insensitive substring search over title, tags and body of
  granted notes.

Write tools (create/append/edit) ship in a later change (#169).

## Why vite-node

`src/lib/homebase/config.ts` and friends use Vite's `import.meta.env` and the `@/` import
alias. `vite-node` resolves both exactly as the app does — plain `node`/`tsx` would throw
on `import.meta.env`.
